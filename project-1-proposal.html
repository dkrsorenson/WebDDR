				<h2>I. High Concept</h2>
				<p>It’s Dance Dance Revolution, but you use your fingers!</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>II. Genre</h2>
				<p>Rhytm, Music, Exergaming</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>III. Platform</h2>
				<p>Desktop</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>IV. Story</h2>
				<p>You’re dancing for your own enjoyment with your fingers.</p>
			</section>
			
			
			<section>
				<h2>V. Esthetics</h2>
				<p>8-Bit graphics of arrows darting across screen. Sounds that aren’t the music will also be 8-bit.</p>
				<p>There will be music playing to play along to, how well you hit each arrow, and victory / failure sounds.</p>
			</section>
			
			<section>
				<h2>VI. Gameplay</h2>
				<h3>Mechanics</h3>
				<p>The player is able to hit the four arrow keys (or WASD) to the beat of the song, simulating playing alongside it.</p>
				
				<h3>Control</h3>
				<p>Keyboard Only, no mouse input of any kind</p>
				<p>The player can select a song, and then play along to it using WASD and the arrow keys (possible multiplayer implementation).</p>

				<h3>Teaching the game/New user experience aka "Onboarding"</h3>
				<p>The game will have an easier song to learn the game on, and a few songs of varying difficulty</p>
			
				<h3>Player learning</h3>
				<p>The player will learn as they continue to play varying difficulties of songs</p>
				<p>The player’s score will be determined by the accuracy of their key presses when arrows pass by.</p>
				<p>To get the best score, the player will have to get better and better at the game.</p>
			</section>

				<h2>VIII. Other</h2>
				<p>We may end up using some kind of music/8-Bit library for sounds and music, but other than that it will be all created by us.</p>
				<p>We may implement both multiplayer, a level creator, and a server connection to store completed songs online depending on how long it takes to create the base of the game.</p>
