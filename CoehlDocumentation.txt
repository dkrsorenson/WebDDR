Project 2: Web DDR
GITHUB link: https://github.com/dkrsorenson/WebDDR

The only change we made was not having sound effects on the arrow hits, it was too much with the music playing

Media
Theres both bg music, song music, and menu sound effects in our game
We have images that are the album cover (or similar imagery) or each song
We have our own font thats DDRish
We have a dancing sprite that uses a spritesheet
The arrows are all drawn with a specific path that is entirely based on width height x and y, not hard coded

Interaction
No mouse controls as we said in proposal, just Arrow Keys (WASD in game for worse keyboards like my laptops), enter and escape
Controls are very easy
Key daemon is set up to capture multihits and iskeydown, not just iskey

Usability
Learning the game is very simple, just follow along to the beat and hit the arrows
The play is able to easily tell if they are selecting a song or playing it, the screen look very different
Some songs are easy, some are hard
Custom UI buttons and sliders made in canvas, but no DOM elements used other than canvas
5 "scenes", start options select game and end
Names are on first screen

Game Design
We met exactly what we said we would do for the plan
The game is playable, has easy to see health and has a working win/lose state (with highscores)
You have a choice of song
You can get higher scores in the game, which adds both depth in how well you can play and gives the player the ability to improve
You either enjoy rythmn games or hate them
The sprites only move across screen, but the text that depicts how well you did move randomly and fade out of existence after a second

Coding
I think we coded good
We used Tech Stack 2, for reference
We didn't end up using any external libraries for this project

Thoughts on project
I think the project went quite well, we got large sections of the game done together, and were able to effectively create a good portfolio piece
If we had more time, I would refine the way we choose how arrows spawn. Its ok right now, but making it so that instead of being delayed by a few seconds
being instant would be better
Other features would include a real DDR pad, multiplayer, more songs, online song searching, and a spritesheet that follows your playing
We used a sound effect from the nintendo switch, songs from youtube, and images from google to match those songs

Partner Work
Coehl worked in the game scene, creating and managing the spritesheet, the font, the health, the ways the arrows were made, the hit effects, the boop sound, arrow timing, and original scene management
Dakota worked on the looping select a song, the general look, the main menu, the score system, the options menu, the songs, the curved boxes, the audio manipulation, and the song information themselves
